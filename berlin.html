                  <h3><strong>“I Love to Travel Because”</strong></h3>
                  <p>I deeply believe travel makes you richer, not in your wallet,
                     but in your intelligence and compassion. Not to mention, 
                     roaming this planet makes you realize your full potential 
                     and helps you learn what makes you truly happy. Let’s break 
                     it down.It’s obvious to everyone who meets me that I love 
                     traveling. The idea of travel, packing my bags and disappearing to 
                      someplace new, lives inside the brain all the time. </p>
        
                  <p>"I love to travel because not only is it the ultimate adventure 
                      but it also exposes you to new types of people, different ways 
                      of living, and opens up your mind. I just like to walk around 
                      in beautiful places that resemble the shire from Lord of the 
                      Rings while exploring new culinary terrains."</p>
