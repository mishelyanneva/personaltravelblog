               <p class="p"> A UNESCO World Heritage Site and the capital of Brandenburg, 
                Potsdam is located on the banks of the Havel River and a short
                 distance from Berlin. With its authentic charm, picturesque
                  brilliance and rich history, the city is a cultural gem well worth visiting.
                  I am very happy that I had the opportuniry to visit this amazing heritage.

            <strong>
            In German there are two main words for castle: Burg and Schloss.</strong> <br>In English they can be translated in 
            various ways, but generally a Burg is a fortress (a castle designed for defense in battle, also called
             eine Festung) and a Schloss is a palace – designed more as a residence. 

            Most of the castles in Germany were designed as royal 
             residences, and most of them are called Schlösser (palaces) in German, even though they are often called
              “castles” in English (such as Schloss Neuschwanstein, Neuschwanstein Castle). No matter. Call them what
               you will, they are all fascinating places to visit and explore!</p>

                    <h2>Sanssouci Palace</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p>This place can be called a must have for any tourist who visited as Potsdam in general,
                       as this park especially. Beautiful architecture of the palace itself. It is very
                        large and stands on a hill with a huge garden near it that looks like giant stairs.
                         In the center of the garden is a large fountain. Although in itself it is not very
                         breathtaking, it is surrounded by beautiful sculptures and benches for relaxation.
                           You can either walk along the tiers of this beautiful green garden and sit by
                            the fountain, or go up to the palace and sit in one of two beautiful arbors
                             at its edges. One symbolizes the Sun, the other - the Moon (metal Sun and 
                             the Moon hang on them). You can go to the museum's shop that is on the 
                             other side of the palace, near the entrance. In fact, you can visit the museum itself inside the palace. Everyone can take
                    an audio guide in several languages. This museum is big.<br><br>
                    <strong>Should you visit this museum?</strong> ... <br>Perhaps yes, I can recommend this place to anyone 
                    who at least loves art and who is at least a little interested in history, as this
                    place has many interesting exhibits about which the audio guide tells some interesting things.

                    <h2>New Palace</h2>
                    
                  </div>
                 
                  <p>In strong contrast to the intimate Sanssouci Palace, the New Palace
                       served as the venue for official, representational needs. Built
                        by King Frederick II at the western end of Sanssouci Park, it 
                        is the largest and most impressive complex in Sanssouci.
                        The palace was begun in 1763, after the end of the Seven Years' War, under King Friedrich II
                         and was completed in 1769. It is considered to be the last great Prussian Baroque palace.
                        <br><br>This is a much overlooked building in Sansoucci, which is unfortunate because
                        it's one of the most impressive buildings. The columns, buildings and staircases 
                        are perfect and great examples of architecture style that isn't replicated today.
                        The statues are life-like, and entertaining to see. It's easy to see that the artists
                         had a rich fantasy and sense of humor. <br><br>
                         This palace was a great surprise for me. I had the chance to see a residence of the Royal Family of Germany (Prussia) and trying to imagine how their life used to be back then.

If you happen to be in Potsdam, get off at Potsdam Sanssouci Park railway station and take a short walk away for the palace. You won't regret it.

                  </div>
                  <p>Cecilienhof Palace is a palace in Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany, built from 1914 
                      to 1917 in the layout of an English Tudor manor house. Cecilienhof was the last 
                      palace built by the House of Hohenzollern that ruled the Kingdom of Prussia and
                       the German Empire until the end of World War I. It is famous for having been the 
                       location of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, in which the leaders of the Soviet 
                       Union, the United Kingdom and the United States made important decisions affecting the shape of post World War II Europe and Asia. Cecilienhof has been part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990.
                   <br> <br>A very nice place to go for the day. Lovely gardens and a nice atmosphere. I I 
                   would recommend this to any travellers looking for history. The Postdam Conference
                    took place here and is one of the most important historical events of the 20th 
                    century. It is regarded worldwide as a symbol of the end of the Second World
                     War and the outbreak of the Cold War.</p>
